# keras-project
Creating regression models with the following characteristics, to observe the difference in efficiency in each: 
1. Regression model with one hidden layer.
2. Regression medel with one hidden layer and normalized data.
3. Regression model with one hidden layer and normalized data , but with twice the number of epochs/ iterations in training.
4. Regression model with three hidden layers.
